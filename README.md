All the files can be found in the gh-pages branch. The files are organized as follows:

- `repos.txt` contains the list of repositories to be included in the gallery.
- `index.Rmd` is the Rmarkdown file that generates the index.html file.
- `index.html` is the main file that contains the gallery.
- `meta.csv` contains the metadata for each repository.
- `error.csv` contains the list of repositories that could not be included in the gallery.
- `screenshots/{repo_owner}/` contains the screenshots of the visualizations present in the repositories for a particular owner
